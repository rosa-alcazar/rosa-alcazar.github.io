# Mission

To improve STEM undergraduate education by bringing resources to colleges serving first-generation and underrepresented minority students. 

# Vision

Genomics data science has become foundational to modern biology research.  To create a just research community, we must bring the necessary resources to places that excel in serving people from underrepresented populations.  While community colleges offer a pathway for many who otherwise wonâ€™t be able to attend college, these institutions lack the compute infrastructure, curriculum, and professional development necessary for instruction in rapidly changing fields.  In partnership with a network of dedicated researchers and educators, we are building a community to provide resources that are accessible by anyone, anywhere with an internet connection.  Our vision is to share not only data but expertise irrespective of institutional affiliation, breaking down barriers that create silos perpetuating a homogenized research community. 

# About

I'm a Latina, first-generation high school graduate and I attended community college while working full-time as a clerk in downtown L.A. I spent years in a desk job while aimlessly taking courses at Pasadena City College.  My turning point was the encouragement and support of an instructor at PCC, Jose Macias. I went on to transfer to UC Riverside and then received my doctorate from Johns Hopkins University.  I switched from research to teaching because I wanted to contribute towards the development of the next-generation of scientist and STEM professionals. I am currently a Biology Instructor at Clovis Community College and with the support of an NSF award, I am collaborating with a genomics data science network to bring resources and curricular innovation to Clovis Community College.

This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backward compatible with initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
