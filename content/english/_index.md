# Vision

Genomics data science has become foundational to modern biology research.  To create a just research community, we must bring the necessary resources to places that excel in serving people from underrepresented populations.  While community colleges offer a pathway for many who otherwise wonâ€™t be able to attend college, these institutions lack the compute infrastructure, curriculum, and professional development necessary for instruction in rapidly changing fields.  In partnership with a network of dedicated researchers and educators, we are building a community to provide resources that are accessible by anyone, anywhere with an internet connection.  Our vision is to share not only data but expertise irrespective of institutional affiliation, breaking down barriers that create silos perpetuating a homogenized research community. 

# About

She is now a Biology Instructor at Clovis Community College where she advocates for institutional changes to remove systemic barriers in order to create a diverse research community.

This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backward compatible with initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:
